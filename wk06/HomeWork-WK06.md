### Journal Entries (2)

Now that we're starting on the Mid-Term project, your Journal is **THE** place for you to log your daily activity. You should be spending a little bit of time gathering material and inspiration and adding it here, building out code, and sharing samples, asking questions, describing your challenges.

If you need inspiration, dig into the [Class Resources](https://github.com/pds-nyu-idm-cc/DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/blob/master/resources.md) page.

I want to see posts that took thought, show reflection. At minimum, you should be asking and/or answering three questions about something you saw, something you're working on, a challenge you're facing (code related), or a challenge you overcame (again, code related).

There's a new method of keeping our journal! See [this guide](https://github.com/pds-nyu-idm-cc/DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/blob/master/github_help/github_wiki.md) for how to clone and post your journal entries to the class wiki.

### Mid-Term Projects

Submit your 1-page description of your project and begin work gathering materials, identifying examples from within Processing and online that might help you. When you discover something, when you have an idea, write a Journal Entry for it!

I'd like to see at least 3 Project related posts concerning the above, plus Processing or P5.js sketches that have outlines and comments indicating how you are planning your project.
