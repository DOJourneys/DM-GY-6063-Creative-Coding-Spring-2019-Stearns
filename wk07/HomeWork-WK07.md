## Your Assignments

### Readings/Watching

* Read: Learning Processing - Ch. 10-11
* Read: GD P.2.3.2-P.2.3.6; M.1.0-M.2.5
* Read: [Nature of Code introduction](https://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/)
* Watch: [Javascript Objects, Map and random- 2.3-2.5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)
* Work on Midterm Project (see below)

### Journal Entries (2)

*If you're having trouble updating your Journal, make sure that you've been keeping your branches up to date!*

1. Pull from Origin
2. Merge the Master (wiki) or Upstream/Master (class repo) into *Your Branch* (never work from the master branch)
3. Commit any changes you've made to your branch
4. Push the changes
5. If you're submitting class work, create a pull request

_**Habitually maintain your branch with the latest changes!**_

Now that we're working on the Mid-Term project, your Journal is **THE** place for you to log your *daily* activity. You should be spending time gathering material and inspiration and adding it here, building out code, and sharing snippets, asking questions, describing your challenges. Are you searching for answers? Have you found a good resource for Processing projects? Have you checked out the forum?

### Mid-Term Projects

You already have:

1. A statement of what you are making/creating/building
2. Research into similar projects, topics, theories, your subject
3. A Plan on what you need to do in order to make a working interactive prototype in Processing or P5.js

You need to:

1. Post your daily progress to github. Work from your student_work folder if necessary.
2. Ask questions of your classmates on Slack. You should have both the desktop app and the mobile app setup.
3. Come to me for conceptual and project management advice/guidance.
4. Make use of the TA for technical.

###How am I evaluating the Projects?

Does the project have a clearly defined goal?

Has the student demonstrated research into technical, cultural, aesthetic, theoretical, etc. contexts of their project?

Does the project explore the use of code in a creative application. Is it oriented towards creating an experience or solving an aesthetic problem, or exploring the creative possibilities of a set of techniques? 

Has the student produced a wireframe prototype of a complex project or have they completed a working prototype that meets their goals? 

If a wireframe prototype, has the functionality been simulated convincingly?

If a functional prototype, does it fulfill the basic goals outlined in their proposals?

If challenges were faced, was an effort made to find solutions using class resources? Were these challenges well documented?
 
To what degree does the work demonstrate an understanding of the following concepts:

* Code Structure, Flow and Readability
* Variables
* Arrays
* Functions
* Classes
* Conditional Statements
* Iteration via Loops
* Interaction
