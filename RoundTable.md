# Final Project

Open ended. It's more about your own creative path and following your interests. The focus now is less on finding what is possible, and more about bringing together what you've learned into a single package.

Many of you are on different paths, integrating many elements or focusing only on one. Each is right. The Final Project is about bringing together the technical concepts to execute on the creative. To refine both.

## Your sketches should:

* Extend the work you've already done 
* Demonstrate technical proficiency
	* Modularity (Custom Functions, Classes)
	* Control Flow (Logic)
	* Structure (When to use Arrays, ArrayLists)
* Be well documented
	* README.md
	* Comments
* Interactivity of some kind
* Exported  to a self-contained application

## Pitch Your Final Projects:

Pitch decks are an industry standard format for quickly conveying the concept and vision behind an idea.
