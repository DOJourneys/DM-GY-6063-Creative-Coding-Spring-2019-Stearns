## Your Assignments

### Reading/Watching

* Watch: [Shiffman, Learning Processing: 11.1-11.2 (including sub-videos)](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2)
* Prepare Pitch Decks and Presentations for Roundtable

### Journal Entries

As always, a minimum of 2. Coding related. Demonstrate that you're working through or with the assigned material or your own coding related projects.



# Final Project

Open ended. It's more about your own creative path and following your interests. The focus now is less on finding what is possible, and more about bringing together what you've learned into a single package.

Many of you are on different paths, integrating many elements or focusing only on one. Each is right. The Final Project is about bringing together the technical concepts to execute on the creative. To refine both.

## Your sketches should:

* Extend the work you've already done 
* Demonstrate technical proficiency (either use or explain why you didn't use a technique):
	* Modularity (Custom Functions, Classes)
	* Control Flow (Logic)
	* Structure (When to use Arrays, ArrayLists)
	* Media (Images, Sound, Saving Output)
* Be well documented
	* README.md
	* Comments
* Interactivity of some kind
* Exported  to a self-contained application

## Pitch Your Final Projects April 16th:

Pitch decks are an industry standard format for quickly conveying the concept and vision behind an idea.

1. Build Your Deck
2. Pitch Your Deck

**Build it:**

* 5 Slides
* Use Images
* Bullet Point Text

**Pitch it:**

* 5 Minute Presentation
* Who are you.
* What are you making.
* Why are you making it.
* What do you need to make it.
* Ask for feedback on a specific point.
