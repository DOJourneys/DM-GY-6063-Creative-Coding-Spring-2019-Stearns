4. Do this for a rectangular button


## Challenge 02: Collisions

1. Create two balls and make the move around on the screen.
2. Add functionality that will keep the balls on the screen, simulating a simple collision with a wall.
3. Do not let the edge of the balls leave the screen.

## Challenge 03: Interaction

1. Make a shape track your mouse position.
2. Make a shape ease to your mouse position.
3. Make a shape avoid your mouse.

## Challenge 04: Randomization
