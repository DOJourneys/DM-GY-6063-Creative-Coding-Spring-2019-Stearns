# Week 10 Homework:

## Class Review:

Some of the topics we covered:

* Image Manipulation: Pixel Sorting + Vector Drifting

## Research Presentations

Have a look [here](https://github.com/pds-nyu-idm-cc/DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/blob/master/research_presentation.md) for who's up next!

## Your Assignments

### Reading/Watching

* Read: Learning Processing - Ch. 17
* Read: GD P.3.0 - 3.2.3
* Prepare presentations for Roundtable

### Journal Entries

As always, a minimum of 2. Coding related. Demonstrate that you're working through or with the assigned material or your own coding related projects.

## Assignment 05

### Image Manipulation

Show off your image manipulation skills. Make the wildest image filter that all the kids will be using for their insta selfies.

Use a minimum of 3 of the following:

* pixel sorting
* cut and paste
* scaling
* `filter()`
* direct pixel array access
* use of `red()`, `green()`, `blue()`, `alpha()`, `brightness()`, `saturation()`, `hue()`;

Make it interactive via 1 of the following:

* mouse
* key presses
* sound
* video

Make it output an image or image sequence using one of the following techniques:

* `Pimage.save()`
* `PGraphic.save()`
* `saveFrame()`
* save to PDF?

## Final Projects

Open ended. It's more about your own creative path and following your interests. The focus now is less on finding what is possible, and more about bringing together what you've learned into a single package.

Many of you are on different paths, integrating many elements or focusing only on one. Each is right. The Final Project is about bringing together the technical concepts to execute on the creative. To refine both.

### Your sketches should:

* Extend the work you've already done 
* Demonstrate technical proficiency (either use or explain why you didn't use a technique):
	* Modularity (Custom Functions, Classes)
	* Control Flow (Logic)
	* Structure (When to use Arrays, ArrayLists)
	* Media (Images, Sound, Saving Output)
* Be well documented
	* README.md
	* Comments
* Interactivity of some kind
* Exported  to a self-contained application

### Pitch Your Final Projects April 16th:

Pitch decks are an industry standard format for quickly conveying the concept and vision behind an idea.

1. Build Your Deck
2. Pitch Your Deck

**Build it:**

* 5 Slides
* Use Images
* Bullet Point Text

**Pitch it:**

* 5 Minute Presentation
* Who are you.
* What are you making.
* Why are you making it.
* What do you need to make it.
* Ask for feedback on a specific point.
