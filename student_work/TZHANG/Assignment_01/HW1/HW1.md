The Journal To Creative Coding - Part 1 

I am Tao ZHANG, just a newbie accidentally stepping into the world of UI & UX, Interaction design and physical computing. I am curious about all the things happening around and willing to devote my time on creating these mystical gadgets. My background is all about computer science and artificial intelligence, I never actually thought about how is the life cycle for a product, and the relationship between my software skills and interaction design. The first time I saw human computer interaction projects in MIT Media Lab, tangible interaction group, I was impressed by the way they were using  various common material and objects to tell a story, and behind all of that, is software and hardware. I never expect how computer looks like when someone put clothes on it, everything changes. Therefore, I decided to pursuit on the way of bridging the gap between technology and human. Well the first step to start is becoming a good UX designer.
