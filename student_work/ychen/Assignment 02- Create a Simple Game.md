## My Game (sort of...)

I created a very very simple game with the input of mouse clicking. There is a ball (aka circle) moving around the defined area. Whenever the mouse clicks on the area of the ball, score goes up by one and the ball will change to a different color randomly. If the mouse misses the target/ball, the lives go down by one.  

When scores reach 10, the player wins and the message of "Congrats!" will be shown. If lives drop down to 0, the player loses and the message of "Game Over!" will be shown.

## Challenges

When coding this project, I encountered many challenges. However, I would just name two biggest ones here. The first one was to figure out how to change numbers of scores/lives depending on where the mouse clicks. The second challenge was to figure out how to stop the game, whether the player wins or loses. I figured out most of them by watching Shiffman's videos.


## Questions

1. How do I restart the game? 
2. The ball is moving with a noticeable patternâ€”how do I make it move randomly or in different directions on the screen?
