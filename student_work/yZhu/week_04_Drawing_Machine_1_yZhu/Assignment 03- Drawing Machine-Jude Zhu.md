For the Drawing Machine project, I am going to reproduce Piet Mondrian's "Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow" (1930).

A well-known work of, Mondrian contributes to the abstract visual language in a large way despite using a relatively small canvas. Thick, black brushwork defines the borders of the different geometric figures. Comparably, the black brushwork on the canvas is minimal but it is masterfully applied to become one of the defining features of the work.

####Lines and shapes:
Big red square, the blue rectangular under the red's left corner, the yellow rectangular under the red's right corner, and four other white rectangulars fill out the space. The rectangulars have black strokes. Two strokes are thicker than others.

####Color in RGB:
* Red (210, 23, 36)
* Yellow (245, 208, 47)
* Blue (9, 76, 149)
* White (223, 227, 226)
* Stroke (0)

####Texture:
On canvas. No reflection.

####Note on the design of drawing machine to recreate this art piece:
I want to make a drawing machine to randomly recreate the composition. The shapes are going to relocate themselves according to the randomly assigned big red square.
