# Yundi Jude Zhu's Midterm Project: Sponge Bob AR Selfie App prototype
### IDM Spring 2019 Creative Coding

This is a prototype for taking selfies with AR characters from Spongebob. It's designed for Dumbo Selfie Challenge, an initiative for calling people to explore Dumbo area, collecting the AR stickers on site, and take selfies that looks like undersea. because of the climate change, Dumbo area will be undersea due to the sea level rising.

In this prototype, you are able to interact with the bubbles with your mouse. The bubbles will follow your mouse, and once you click on the screen, the bubbles will be pushed away.

You can also click on the headshot below to show Spongebob characters. They will stand on your shoulder. They will follow you anywhere as long as your face is in the camera.

You can take play around the the characters and bubbles and pose for a photo by pressing the camera icon. The photo will be stored in the same folder.

Enjoy and let's save the planet!
