What I hope to get out of this class is to learn how to use coding languages in creative ways and I hope to see coding in a different way. I have a minimal experience in coding (html, css, javascript) from my undergraduate years and I haven’t practiced it much so like any language, I’m a bit rusty on the subject. As of now, I also see coding as something that is completely not my forte and something that I truthfully, could not see myself doing well in. Because of that, I hope that this class will help me view coding in a different way!  

I was introduced to Zach Lieberman last semester and that really inspires me to learn how to program. I realize that it’s an essential skill to have in this day and age, and it’s really inspiring to see artists use code to make interactive art.
