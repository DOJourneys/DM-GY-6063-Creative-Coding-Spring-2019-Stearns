In her work The Eclipse, we see her technique executed beautifully. I can pinpoint immediately her use of shape for these slight;y varying rectangles that make up sun rays and color that complement each other but what really stands out is the pattern. In all of her work, shapes are aranged in a linear (or circular) fashion creating a consistency across the board.
