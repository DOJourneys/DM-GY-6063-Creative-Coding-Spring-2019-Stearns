## Creative Coding: An Intro to Creative Coding
2 Metro Tech Center Rm 811<br>
6:30 - 9:20pm Tuesday

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no programming experience, who are interested in creating interactivity.  Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result.  In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking - to think concurrently and modularly.  By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for creating interactivity including: event-driven creative applications, interactive installations,  graphical user interfaces, games and user interfaces.  Interactivity will be introduced and discussed throughout.
