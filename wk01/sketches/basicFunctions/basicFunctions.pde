/*
There are two primary functions that make a Processing sketch:

setup() and draw()

These must be declared.

When declaring these and any custom fuction, you must include:
1. return data type
2. function name
3. arguments
4. your code

*/

// setup() is used to initialize variables and objects
// it runs once at the beginning of your program

void setup(){

//'void' is the returned data type (it doesn't return anything)
//'setup' is the name of the function
// arguments go between ()
// code goes between {}  

}

// draw() is run continuously in a loop until exit() is called

void draw(){
  
// any code that you place here is run repeatedly

}
