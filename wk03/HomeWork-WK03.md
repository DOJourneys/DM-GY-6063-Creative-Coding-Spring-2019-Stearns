# Week 03 Homework:

## Class Review:

Cool the see the range of approaches to making a game with fairly simple mechanics. It might not seem like much, but we've actually come a long way.

* WK 01 - We started from scratch, covering basic structure of Processing code, built-in functions and hard-coded values were par for the course
* WK 02 - We did some heavy lifting with variables, types, operations, boolean expressions, conditionals, and loops. Oh yeah, and we also had interactivity as well as motion in there too.
* WK 03 - We're working with motion, controlling the flow of our code with if statements and for loops. We reviewed Arrays and For loops and introduced accelerated motion as well as classes.

Thanks to Jay for the presentation on Casey Reas and Siebren Versteeg. They represent two distinct perspective on using code in their creative practice.

Have a look [here](https://github.com/pds-nyu-idm-cc/DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/blob/master/research_presentation.md) for who's up next!

I think some of the big take aways for this class come for the code modifications performed in class:

1. Get comfy with abstraction. Our code should be easy to read, with functions containing only a handful of lines of code. The mechanics can be hidden away so that we can focus on behaviors and flow
2. Math is somehow unfamiliar in the context of code. In terms of motion, position is static, you need to add speed to position to get motion. In order to get accelerated motion (e.g. gravity), you add acceleration to speed, and speed to position. You know... derivatives, from Calculus, applied to Physics, expressed as math within code.
3. Keep practicing the basics, those things that you might not understand fully. Find examples in the resources ([processing.org](processing.org/reference), Learning Processing, the Processing built-in Examples...) and get in touch on slack!

## Your Assignments

### Readings/Watching

There should be a lot of overlap, so pick whichever method works best for you. Don't do everything, just review, tinker with, and absorb the material.

1. Explore [https://processing.org/reference/](https://processing.org/reference/) (leisurely)

2. Explore the examples in File > Examples > Basics and Topics. Focus on Arrays, Control, Interaction, Motion.

3. Read: Learning Processing - Ch. 5 - 6 (intently)
4. Watch: Shiffman, Learning Processing 7 (including sub-videos) (for fun!)

### Journal Entries (2)

There's a new method of keeping our journal! See [this guide](https://github.com/pds-nyu-idm-cc/DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/blob/master/wiki_help/wiki_help.md) for how to clone and post your journal entries to the class wiki.


### Coding Assignment 2 (part 2)

Complete your game!

Looking for the following:

* Scoring Mechanism (involved overlap or collision detection)
* Different States: Playing, Win, Lose
* Advance in difficulty

Like some of the games in progress, simple elements and simple mechanics can still produce engaging games.

Bonus points for:

* unique visual style
* structuring your code using functions (abstraction! yas!)

For the more advanced coders:

* Create classes for your game objects
* Bonus, create a GameObject class and extend it to create your different objects.
* Use ArrayLists to dynamically add and remove objects from play.
